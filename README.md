# FitJourney Project 1
## Project Description
As individuals who are looking to be more health conscious, we wanted to create an application that takes pertinent data from a user such as daily water intake, food consumption, hours exercised and hours slept and observe changes over a 7 day period. Using functions written in JavaScript we are able to calculate calories burned and caloric intake to provide data that is then graphed to show flucuations over a set amount of time.
## Installation
N/A
## Using FitJourney
Start by adding data into the input fields in the aside element to provide the application with data about user goals Hit submit to store the data to be included in the graphing functions. Track your overall wellness overtime as you frequently add new data points.
